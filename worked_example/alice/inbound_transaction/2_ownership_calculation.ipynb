    "1. Prince could hash Alice's public view key, ensure the hash is a valid curve scalar and then multiply that by G to get a new public key. That would be a new address but anyone with Alice's public view key would be able to derive everything. That's not a shared secret.\n",
    "2. Prince creates a random number `r` and calculates `rK`. Alice can calculate `k(rG)`. Both of those are the same, but Alice only needs `rG`. It is not possible to recover `r` from `rG` so Prince can put `rG` in transaction data without worrying that someone else can calcualate `r`. \n",
    "    * Why is it important to hide `r` from outside observers? \n",
    "        * Anyone with Alice's Monero address has access to her public keys, and using `r` could recreate the stealth address: H(rKv) + Ks. That's not a shared secret. But hiding `r` creates a shared secret.\n",
    "    * For clarity:\n",
    "        * `rK` = `rkG` = `krG`\n",
    "        * Adding parenthesis for clarity: `rK` = `r(kG)` = `k(rG)`\n",
    "3. Prince adds Alice's public spend key to the prior data to create `H(rKv)G` + `Ks`. Both Prince and Alice can create this address. This value is equal to [`H(rKv)` + `ks`]`G` which means the private key is `H(rKv)` + `ks`. Prince has created an address that only he and Alice can create but with a private key that only Alice can create.\n",
    "    * What's wrong with just using `H(rKv)G`?\n",
    "        * The private key for `K(rKv)G` is the portion before the final `G`, `H(rKv)`. Prince obviously has access to that which means Prince would be able to spend that output. That's not good.\n",

In the same way it is completely different from `rKv` + `Ks` (the value Prince calculated).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two pieces of data used and the reason for those are as follows:\n",
    "* `r`: The value r is hidden from evil third parties but can be used directly by Prince and indirectly (rG) by Alice to create the same result.\n",
    "* `Ks`: The public spend key is added because Prince does not know the corresponding private key and thus cannot calculate the stealth address private key.\n",

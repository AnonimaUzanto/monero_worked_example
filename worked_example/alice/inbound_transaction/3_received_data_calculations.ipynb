To spend Monero Alice will need to provide a validator enough information to confirm the transaction is valid without providing a specific amount. She will need to use data that was also used in calculating the commitment in the transaction destined to her. The outPk field contains a commitment to the amount Alice recieved, and the commitment is a curve point.

    "One question that may arise is, why can't the amount be recovered directly from the commitment rather than being stored again in a separate location `ecdhInfo \\ amount`? Recall that the commitment is yG + bH. Alice has access to G and H (known curve points), and can calculate y and thus yG. Alice could subtract yG from the commitment to obtain bH. Given bH and H can Alice recover b? No. In this instance b is the private key for the curve point bH, and it is not possible to recover a prive key. That is why the amount is stored in both the commitment and in the amount field."

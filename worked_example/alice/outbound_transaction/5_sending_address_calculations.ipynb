    "In the previous sections Alice identified a transaction destined for her, and extracted all information she could from the transaction.

The section after this one will cover Alice preparing amounts to sendd.\n",

The second address is used to send return change of 0 Monero, but instead of sending a zero Monero output to Alice, a zero Monero output is send to a random address.

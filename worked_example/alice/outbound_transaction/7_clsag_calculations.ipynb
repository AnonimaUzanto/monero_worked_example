    "## 1. Calculating the commitment to zero private key\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice received Monero in a commitment in transaction be71, and is spending all of that Monero in a new transaction that has commitments for Bob and for zero change sent to a random address. A validator needs to ensure the inputs amounts equal the output amounts. If Alice directly references the prior output then the validator would be able to determine which output Alice owned and is spending, which would defeat Monero's privacy. Instead the process looks more like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Validate that the sum of output commitments (including transaction fees) equal the sum of pseduo-commitments\n",
    "2. Validate that the difference in amounts between the real prior commitment and the pseduo-commitment is zero\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform step 2 Alice has to create a commitment to zero that proves the amount in the pseduo-commitment is equal to the amount in the real prior commitment. In Alice's example transaction there is a single prior commitment and a single pseduo-commitment, and the only difference between the two is the blinding factors used (y). Alice will use the difference in blinding factors as a commitment to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output Alice received was generated with `y_received*G + bH`; and the pseduo-commitment Alice created was generated with `y_pseudo*G + bH`. Subtracting the second equation from the first leaves `(y_pseudo - y_received)*G`. The private key for that difference is `(y_pseudo - y_received)`. That will be the commitment to zero private key. "

    "One of the decoys Alice happened to select was a mining coinbase output. The amounts for these outputs are in cleartext and the outputs do not record a commitment in the blockchain. Because a commitment is required for use in messaging signing (CLSAG), a commitment is created using the cleartext amount. Recall that a commitment is typically `yG + bH` where `y` in the blinding factor and `b` is the amount. The amount for a coinbase output is known, and since there is no corresponding blinding factor, `y` is simply set to the number 1. The corresponding commitment is `1*G + bH`. Coinbase commitments used as decoys in CLSAG are recreated using this formula by senders and validators. The commitment is recreated in this section. "

    "## 5. Creating CLSAG input data\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice has accumulated most of the information she needs to sign the message with CLSAG. Using the data she has already accumulated Alice will created the final inputs required for the signature. To clarify the signing process for this worked example, the information Alice needs will be generated and then put into four separate lists. There will be 16 items in each list, one for each ring member.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice started with stealth addresses and commitments for each of the ring members. She will perform two additional actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a key image base for each of the stealth addresses using the `hash_to_point()` function. This is similar to the process Alice uses to create her own key image. Recall that the key image was calculated as `stealth_address_private_key * hash_to_point(stealth_address)`. Alice of course does not know the stealth address private key for ring member decoys, and will only calculate the second portion of that equation.  \n",
    "**Note: this is the one place where the author uses outside functions. Monero uses  `hash_to_point` which maps public keys to new public keys where the private key for the new public key is unknown. The function is very similar to the `nacl.bindings.crypto_core_ed25519_from_uniform` function but with a different way of handling y-coordinates.** \n",
    "2. Create \"fake\" commitments to zero by taking the ring member commitments and then subtracting her own pseudo-commitment. The values created here are used in CLSAG but, because Alice does not know the amounts the ring member decoys represent, they are not true commitments to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice will also create a key image for the commitment to zero. This is an auxiliary key that is stored in the transaction data in the CLSAG section as `D`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Alice will generate random numbers used in signing the message. Normally these are generated by wallet software and stored in the CLSAG section of the transaction. Because this is a worked example for a real transaction the random numbers will be read directly from the actual spend transaction. The list of random numbers will be modified to remove one value that will be created by the CLSAG signature."

If her true spend was at another position, for example 7, then she would create her expected CLSAG output and then loop through 8 to 15 and then 0 to 6."
